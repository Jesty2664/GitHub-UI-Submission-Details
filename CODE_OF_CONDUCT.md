That's a great request! I'll rewrite the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certificate Course Code of Conduct two different times.

Here are two distinct versions: one focusing on Clarity and Directness and the other on Collaborative and Enthusiastic Tone.

Rewritten Version 1: Clarity and Directness (The "Rules of Engagement")
This version prioritizes straightforward language and a focus on actionable expectations and consequences.
